    <div class="article__content">
        <p>Microfrontends is a new trend in the frontend world however, the idea of being able to compose an application out of other
independent applications is not new. Previous experiences such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Portlet_Specification">Java Portlets</a> have not been very successful while other companies, such as <a href="https://medium.com/hacking-talent/two-years-of-micro-frontends-a-retrospective-522526f76df4">Beamery</a> or <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-is-JavaScript-used-within-the-Spotify-desktop-application-Is-it-packaged-up-and-run-locally-only-retrieving-the-assets-as-and-when-needed-What-JavaScript-VM-is-used/answer/Mattias-Petter-Johansson">Spotify</a>, have tried the Microfrontends path with mixed results.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would bet that the Spotify desktop client is among the top 25 most intricate uses of JavaScript in the world. — <em>Mattias Petter Johansson (Spotify)</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite that success, we found our move to micro-frontends also created some new challenges for us. If you’re thinking about taking this path, we hope that you can learn from our experience — <em>Brody Mckee (Beamery)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within the Microfrontends discussion, <a href="https://overreacted.io">Dan Abramov</a> (React Core team, Redux creator) condensed his concerns in a popular <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1132493678730252288">tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t understand Microfrontends — <em>Dan Abramov</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why this Microfrontends trend then? Is there substance to it? Is it worth considering?</p>

<h3 id="the-monolith">The monolith</h3>

<p>Single Page Applications have been around for a decade or so and while classic backend frameworks can provide a decent UX on the frontend (ie: <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html#turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>, <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com">LiveWire</a>), they have been the de-facto standard when it comes to the view layer for most applications.</p>

<p>A <em>frontend monolith</em> is the result of years of continuous development and related technical debt within a single page application. The challanges that come with these kind of applications, independently from the team’s engineering discipline, mostly revolve around dependency management, backend coupling, upgrade and more generally scalability. 
Managing a Monolith is perfectly acceptable and sometimes the most efficient way to manage the codebase, especially in smaller teams, as it allows consistent deliveries within a simple architecture.</p>

<p>A migration path for a Monolith is complex as it does not offer a clean way to implement incremental structural changes however, breaking changes would be packaged within a single codebase and could be managed successfully. More often than not, a migration of a Monolith simply means developing a new version alongside a legacy version: old code might be difficult to read, but it would not come with side effects.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="multiple-frontends">Multiple Frontends</h3>

<p>Microfrontends is an architecture pattern that offers an alternative to the <em>frontend monolith</em> by breaking up the frontend into multiple frontends, each with its own lifecycle. Being able to administer an application lifecycle independently from other applications allows teams to deploy features to production faster, as they face less dependencies, a concise scope and less risk of failures.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reducing waiting time between teams is micro frontends’ primary goal. — <em>Michael Geers (Author of Microfrontends in Action, Manning 2020)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The frontend market today offers decent alternatives to the infamous <a href="https://hub.packtpub.com/spotify-has-one-of-the-most-intricate-uses-of-javascript-in-the-world-says-former-engineer/">Spotify’s iframe orchestration</a>: Webpack’s <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/">Module Federation</a>, <a href="https://opencomponents.github.io/">Open Components</a> or technology agnostic frameworks such as <a href="https://single-spa.js.org">Single Spa</a> are prime solutions for implementing Microfrontends, despite their young age.</p>

<p>Managing multiple frontends however is not cheap. While the feature frontends might benefit from a reduced scope and a clean API to communicate with the rest of the application, 
the <em>orchestrator</em> grows in complexity among managing standards, shared state, cache, features API, a uniform UX and inevitable breaking changes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…a bug on this layer could blow up the entire application and the implementation of new features, if not well co-ordinated, could slow down other teams creating a cross-team dependency — <em>Luca Mezzalira (DAZN)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the complexity worth it?</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I feel that Microfrontends is a viable solution for scaling frontend within large teams (&gt; 30 developers) working on a single codebase. Even though teams built this way are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">a product of the organisation’s communication structure</a>, at this scale, it might be a necessary cost in exchange for faster deliveries. Scaling Microfrontends from 30 developers to 100 is a log operation and could incentivise large organisations to structure the teams after the business domain.</p>

<p>On the other side, Microfrontends would be an unnecessary complication for smaller teams where a Monolith could be improved and scaled by simply investing in better engineering standards.</p>
