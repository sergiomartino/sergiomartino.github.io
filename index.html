        <p>This past year has been a wild ride. Our communities have been through what has been one of the <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/the-worst-year-in-history-is-2020-a-contender">worst years in history</a>, one that transformed how we live, work and socialise. Some of these changes are going to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhall/2020/09/21/these-temporary-covid-19-changes-will-become-permanent/?sh=64b37f6f7fc6">permanent</a> and there is <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/">speculation</a> that the impact of these straordinary events could transform society in a way and scale never seen before.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I am grateful I have been able to continue doing my job in 2020, something I love to boot, and I am prepared to embrace/confront change in the upcoming year. So let’s review some of the things I found interesting during the year and what I find exciting looking at 2021.</p>

<h3 id="looking-back">Looking back</h3>

<p>I am surprised to still see React being a top choice for frontend applications. I had a feeling that following the introduction of <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">Hooks</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-patterns.html">Concurrent Mode</a>, the library embarked on a tortuous path where <a href="https://developerexperience.io/practices/good-developer-experience">DX</a> would have resulted being subpar compared to other frameworks. This has not happened yet, however I do sense that React is becoming more and more of a black box and <a href="https://svelte.dev/">niche alternatives</a> could soon replace it.</p>

<p>I was happy to see <a href="https://medium.com/@ScriptedAlchemy">Zach Jackson</a> make it to Webpack with his <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/">Module Federation</a> plugin. This plugin makes Microfrontends development much easier. I have written extensively about this topic on a <a href="/2020/11/microfrontends-an-expensive-recipe-for-frontend-applications/">previous post</a>.</p>

<p>The first stable version of <a href="https://deno.land">Deno</a> caught my attention early this year, mainly because of its ability to import remote modules directly without using <strong>Npm</strong>. It has some other interesting features, such as <strong>Typescript</strong> support, but before diving into a “let’s replace <strong>Node</strong>” discussion, I am waiting to see whether its adoption increases.</p>

<p>As a big fan of the language, I welcomed <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0/">Typescript v4</a>. It has proven to be a mature language so far and something that can be relied upon even within an enterprise environment.</p>

<p>I resumed my <a href="/about-this-blog">personal blog</a> in May, after it being offline for years. In only a few months of life I found an excuse to migrate it ¯_(ツ)_/¯ from <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/blade">PHP/Laravel Blade</a> to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. It was totally unnecessary, but hei… you have got to love these SSGs.</p>

<h3 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h3>

<p>I am keen to see whether <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html">React Server Components</a> take on and whether they will be pushing  <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html">Backends for Frontends</a> patterns further. With <strong>Cloud</strong> becoming cheaper and backend framework features improving frontend UX (<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a>, <a href="https://turbo.hotwire.dev/">Hotwire</a>), I can definitely see frontend and backend development converge.</p>

<p>I am watching <a href="https://recoiljs.org/">Recoil</a> closely. I do like the concept and the <a href="https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/motivation">problem it is trying to solve</a>. At the same time, I am just happy to give up <strong>Redux</strong>, which I find overly verbose. I would be wary considering it    for production: it is still in version 0.1.2 as I type.</p>

<p>I am eyeing <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and its application framework <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a>. While I will probably get a chance to use some of these tools at my job, I am keen to see whether the adoption of <strong>Svelte</strong> by <a href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/">important companies</a> will increase its popularity and allow it to become a better equipped <strong>React</strong>/<strong>Vue</strong> competitor.</p>

<p>I am expecting <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> to decline in popularity. While <strong>Angular</strong> is still very popular today, it does seem to be in the same position <strong>jQuery</strong> was few years ago: I would not start a new project with it.</p>

<p>Last but not least, web support for <a href="https://flutter.dev/web">Flutter</a> should come out of beta. This is an intriguing platform, as it uses a mixture of <strong>Custom Elements</strong> and <strong>Canvas</strong> to paint on the browser. I am not entirely convinced by the paradigm (and <strong>Dart</strong> as platform language), but when Google does it, it is worth taking notes.</p>
